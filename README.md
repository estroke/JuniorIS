Repository for my Junior IS coding portion.
The purpose of this software will be to input a photo and create an animation from the same photo using digital image processing techniques. Using Java, this code will have no UI but will take in an image file, process it, change it according to my desired end result using different algorithms, and create layers of the image so that it appears that it is moving, such is an animation.
