Repository for my Junior IS coding portion.
The purpose of this software will be to input a photo and create an animation from the same photo using digital image processing techniques. Using Java, this code will have no UI but will take in an image file, process it, change it according to my desired end result using different algorithms, and create layers of the image so that it appears that it is moving, such is an animation.
To run the main animation, simply run the imageAnimation.java file using the command java imageAnimation.
To use any of the classes in the 'steps' folder, please make sure the file directories are changed to the correct path. The purpose of this software is to edit my own images, so the path will need to be changed relative to your directory.
